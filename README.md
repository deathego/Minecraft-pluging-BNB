## **What is QuestCraft?**

QuestCraft is a unique **Minecraft server plugin** that adds a **Play-to-Earn** feature to Minecraft. By integrating **blockchain technology** (via smart contracts), players are rewarded with **soulbound crypto tokens** for completing in-game quests. These tokens serve as proof of achievement and unlock additional rewards and opportunities within the server.

## **How QuestCraft Works**

1. **Link Your Crypto Wallet**:

   * Connect your wallet to the server for seamless integration.
2. **Activate a Quest with `/quest`**:

   * Use the command `/quest` in-game to activate a personalized quest based on your skills.
3. **Complete the Quest in 15 Minutes**:

   * Finish the quest within 15 minutes to earn your rewards.
4. **Earn Real Rewards**:

   * Upon completion, the server automatically triggers a smart contract on the Binance Smart Chain Testnet, rewarding you with a **soulbound crypto token** and in-game items like currency or rare loot.

These rewards are **soulbound** to your Minecraft account, making them an authentic proof of your achievements.
