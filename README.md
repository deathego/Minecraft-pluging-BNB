## **What is QuestCraft?**

QuestCraft is a unique **Minecraft server plugin** that adds a **Play-to-Earn** feature to Minecraft. By integrating **blockchain technology** (via smart contracts), players are rewarded with **soulbound crypto tokens** for completing in-game quests. These tokens serve as proof of achievement and unlock additional rewards and opportunities within the server.

3. **Complete the Quest in 15 Minutes**:
